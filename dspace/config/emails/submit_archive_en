Hi,

You submitted: ${params[0]}

Your document is now available in Papyrus unless an embargo period applies as it was 
requested by you or was required because of editor's policy.
In this particular case, the description of your document
is displayed online but the document file(s) will only be available
once the embargo period expires. Submitters can however access their
embargoed files by first logging in with their Papyrus account.

This is the permanent identifier for your document that you can use from
now on when citing your submission:
