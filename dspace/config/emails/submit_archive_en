Hi,

You submitted: ${params[0]}

To collection: ${params[1]}

Your document is now available in Papyrus unless an embargo period applies as it was 
requested by you or was required because of editor's policy.
In this particular case, the description of your document
is displayed online but the document file(s) will only be available
once the embargo period expires. Submitters can however access their
embargoed files by first logging in with their Papyrus account.

This is the permanent identifier for your document that you can use from
now on when citing your submission:

  ${params[2]}

Papyrus will also automatically assign a DOI to theses, dissertations, and student papers, 
as well as to all documents that do not already have a DOI on another platform (e.g., the DOI of the publisher of a published article). 
If applicable, you will be able to see the DOI of your document in the URI field of its description, within 24 hours.

If you have questions, please email depot@bib.umontreal.ca
